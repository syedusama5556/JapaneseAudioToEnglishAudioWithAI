1
0,000 --> 6,000
You are there when it cools down

2
6,000 --> 11,000
It gave me a new morning again

3
11,000 --> 16,000
The beating is very kind

4
16,000 --> 22,000
But I'm so sad that I almost cry

5
22,000 --> 24,000
I'm shouting

6
24,000 --> 27,000
I want to see someone

7
27,000 --> 32,000
I don't know the name again

8
32,000 --> 37,000
The voice is certainly heard

9
37,000 --> 42,000
I just started crying

10
42,000 --> 48,000
Love may not be

11
48,000 --> 56,000
Not for anyone, but for myself

12
58,000 --> 63,000
The sound of the chest goes to the place where the sound is looking for

13
63,000 --> 67,000
At the dawn of a wide feeling that fell here

14
67,000 --> 74,000
Because you told you on the other side

15
74,000 --> 78,000
This time this world is not bad this time

16
78,000 --> 82,000
I think so

17
87,000 --> 90,000
